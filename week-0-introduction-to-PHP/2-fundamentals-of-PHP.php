## 1. Expressions
An expression in PHP is anything that results to a value. Example: 5, 'Hello', 5 + 6, greet();

A Statement in PHP consist of one or more expressions with some other language constructs, that instructs the computer to do something.

- if statements

- switch statement
- shorthand if statement with the ternary operator: ? :


## 5. Functions

Functions in PHP is used to wrap a piece of code which consists some statements and logic, that we can reuse in other parts of our program.

## 6. Working with Arrays

We said an Array in PHP is an ordered collection of items.

We can perform a whole of operations when working with arrays in PHP. We have access to array functions like:

  1. array_push(value): to add an element to the end of the array
  2. array_pop(): to remove the last element from the array
  3. count(array): to return the total number of items in the array
  4. array_shift(): to remove the first item from the array
  5. array_unshift(value): to add an element at the beginning of the array
  6. array_map(callback, array): to loop through the array and generature a new array
  7. array_filter(array, callback): to loop through the array and return the filtered values from the array.
