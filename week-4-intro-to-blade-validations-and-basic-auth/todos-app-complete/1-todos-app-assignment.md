1. Use Laravel Breeze App layout for our Todos App. This means all the routes for your Todos should use this layout.
   
2. Add a **Todos** link to the Navigation menu of the App layout. The link shoud be added next to the **Dashboard** link, and it should take you to the **todos.index** page.

3. Change the default redirect of the logout functionality to take you to the **Login Page**
    
4. On the Login Page, show a link that will take users to the Registration page, so that they can register to the app if they are not existing users. In the same way, add a link to the Register page to take users to the Login page if they are users already.

5. Add the **auth** middleware to all your **Todos** route.
